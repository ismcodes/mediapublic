	<div class="tile one">
		<p>The actual title of the recording, like hey</p>

	<div class="tile two">
		<p>Five Nights at Freddy's: Sensational game or overhyped mess?</p>

		<p class="more">read more &rarr;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Two explorations: 1) let the title be the only content on the tile or 2) clip text and add a teaser to "read more". In both cases, the entire tile is a hit target (great for being touch-friendly).</p>

	<p>We have some options about how much information to show here, and how to show it. Overall, it feels really appropriate to always have links that a visitor can chase - let's say the two most relevant ones about that person. I like sticking them at the bottom because then it's very robust against displacement if the user's name is really long.</p>

	<p>Speaking of long names - we'll definitely need to figure out a good way to handle names (and bios) that are longer than will actually fit. We can probably do it based on the number of characters, but we should talk about this in depth. Either way, that's more of a p2 issue.</p>

<div class="help">
	<h2>Help Requests</h2>

	<div class="tile one">
		<h3>Please help</h3>
	</div>

	<div class="tile two">
		<h3>No, really</h3>
	</div>

	<div class="tile three">
		<h3>Pretty please?</h3>
	</div>

	<p>Honestly, these can/should probably be the same as the recordings.</p>
